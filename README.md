# **NYC Housing and Financial Data Report by Tyriek Warren**
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of various NYC housing and financial data. Some of the highlights of the report are the following:
- The first Stacked Bar Chart showcases the top 10 neighborhoods based on the total number of
properties (broken down further into different types of homes: one, two, and three family homes).
- The Upper East Side (59-79) has the
highest number of properties.
- The Clustered Column Chart compares the mean average sales prices categorized by family homes
revealing that one family homes have the highest average sales prices (over $5.5 million).
- The Funnel Chart presents a visual
representation of home purchases (one family homes are the highest at 50 purchases).
- The pie chart indicates a substantial concentration of One Qualifying Child claims (6,756,453 or close to 7 million claims).
- The line chart illustrates the trajectory of the average qualifying credit from 2004 to 2014, showing a consistent increase in the average credit with each passing year.
- Simultaneously, the last chart draws attention to the distribution of tax claims based on income. The majority of verifiable claims, as
depicted by “Income Distribution and Tax Claims”, emanate from individuals with an earned income falling within the $8,001 to
$12,000 range.

In conclusion, there is a significant difference in finances across neighborhoods in NYC. Single family houses in select neighborhoods tend to prosper financially. At the same time, lower income residents are highly represented in One Child Qualifying Claims as the average qualifying credit continues to increase.
